  <h3>Internet Relay Chat</h3>
	Troubleshooting information regarding IBM PowerPC servers is limited because PPC servers are a niche market typically maintained by datacenter administrators that use them for a specific purpose such as big data analysis, high performance computing, etc.  This website is in fact a response to the small amount of troubleshooting information available on IBM PPC servers and is intended to serve as a quick-start guide for inexperienced admins who need to stand up, and learn to administrate, PPC servers in a short amount of time.  The links below are troubleshooting resources listed in order of most helpful to less helpful (i.e. more general).

  For expert advice from real PPC admins on troubeshooting your IBM PPC server the Freenode Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels are the best.  More specifically the #Fedora-PPC, #CentOS-PPC, #OpenSUSE-PPC and #IBM Freenode channels are the fastest way to great troubleshooting and administration advice.  Keep in mind, however, that the admins and developers on these channels are not there strictly for your troubleshooting pleasure.  They are there to write and maintain PPC OSs, so you can help yourself and them if you have your questions 'sharpened' before you begin a chat session.  If you have never used IRC before you'll need to setup an IRC account, register a nickname and have access to an XMPP (or other messaging protocol) chat client such as Pidgin, Trillian, etc.  The links below cover what's needed for Linux-based admins to reach out to PPC admins.
