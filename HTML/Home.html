      <h1>The Power PC Architecture</h1>
      <p>
        Although the contents of this site deal specifically with IBM PowerPC (PPC) Architecture servers, PPC was originally a joint engineering venture by Apple, IBM and Motorola in 1991.  IBM is the only partner engineering PPC architecutre infrastructure today.  
      </p>
	<p>
	The most important characteristic of the PPC architecture is that it isn't an Intel x86-64 architecture.  Because x86-64 architecture machines make up the vast majority of datacenter servers and personal computers running today, IBM PPC servers usually require provisioning to be done over serial.  If you are new to administrating IBM PPC servers, take a minute to watch this helpful video which is an overview of IBM PPC servers.

<h1>The IBM Hardware Management Console</h1>
<p>
The IBM Hardware Management Console (HMC) is a server management GUI on top of a Linux microkernel, all of which is used for provisioning and administrating PPC servers.  The .iso for this HMC is available from within IBM's support content.  Once obtained it can be installed to a VM saving your company time, money and IT resources.  If you are new to working with IBM's HMC technology, take a minute to watch this helpful video which is an overview of HMC functionality.
